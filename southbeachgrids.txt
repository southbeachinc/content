// support@southbeachinc.com

// This file defines an initial grids library for use with Southbeach Modeller.
// The library is organised as a tree (hierarchy) in the Grids tab of the Toolbox.
// Define charts (xy), swimlanes (rows), pools (columns) and boxes (labelled).

// DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE, IT IS UPDATED IN NEW RELEASES
//
// To extend the library for your applications, create a similar file(s).
// Place any new grid definitions in folder southbeach/MyGrids.
// At startup, definitions are merged according to the hierarchy of # names. 
// Or tight mouse in the Grids panel to re-load files. 

// SYNTAX
// Specify the grid tags for 'rows' and/or 'cols', or labelled 'boxes'. 
// The first word defines the 'separation' (tag group).

// Separations formally defined in Southbeach are: 
// space, time, parts, perspective, aspect, role, probability, condition, version 
// However, any tag group name can act as a separation, e.g. SWOT.

// Additional grids donated by Mark Burnett

// Mentoring

#mentoring.trade-offs.jobs.money/time
// Premise: Most jobs are a trade-off between money earned and time required to do the job
// Explanation: Someone may want to take a job to earn more money but must trade off how much more time they are prepared to spend on the job versus their personal life
// How to use: Place different jobs in the grid according to how much money they would earn and how much time would be required to perform the jobs
cols, trade-off, money, time
rows, degree, high, medium, low

#mentoring.trade-offs.jobs.position/accountability
// Premise: Most jobs are a trade-off between position and accountability
// Explanation: Position is often considered a measure of success or progression and also usually comes with more freedom and authority. An increase in position usually includes more accountability, which can lead to more stress and additional enabling work you are required to do in order to ensure success of not only yourself but also others in lower positions
// How to use: Place different jobs in the grid according to their position and degree of accountability
cols, position, junior, middle management, senior management
rows, accountability, low, medium, high

#mentoring.trade-offs.jobs.job security/opportunity
// Premise: Most jobs are a trade-off between a stable role that is secure and a role in a more volatile environment but that has more opportunities
// Explanation: Stability means lack of change, which can lead to security however can limit development and progression opportunities whereas situations that are more unpredictable provide more opportunities but with increased risk
// How to use: Place different jobs in the grid according to their position and degree of accountability
cols, job security, low, medium, high
rows, opportunity, low, medium, high

cols, risk, low, medium, high
rows, reward, low, medium, high

#mentoring.trade-offs.choices.hold fast/be flexible
// Premise: Holding fast may get you what you want in the short term but can also alienate others and lead to longer term problems
// Explanation: Having flexibility and finding a middle ground can lead to faster progress as you will have the support of others
cols, hold fast, low, medium, high

#trade-offs.precision/complexity
cols, precision, low, medium, high
rows, complexity, low, medium, high

#trade-offs.bias/variance
// Premise: Having stricter more formalised processes can create more consistency at the cost of being biased whereas a more open selection approach may be less biased but produce a greater variance in results due to less rigour
// Explanation: It is difficult to have formalised processes, scores, tests, or criteria, that work for every case but having none at all is usually going to far in the other direction; the trick is to get a balance
cols, bias, low, medium, high
rows, variance, low, medium, high
