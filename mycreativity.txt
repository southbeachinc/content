// DO NOT MODIFIY THIS FILE AS IT IS UPDATED WITH NEW RELEASES

// If you wish to extend the libary and add your own rulesets
// to Southbeach Modeller, create similar .txt files and place
// them in the southbeach/MyCreativity folder.

// Refer to the MyC User Manual to understand more about the rules
// engine features and syntax for writing creativity sentences: 
// https://www.southbeachinc.com/help/index.html

// When you start Southbeach, this file, and others like it, are loaded.
// The rule sets defined appear in the MyCreativity panel of the Toolbox. 
// Rule sets with the same name are merged and displayed as a hierarchy. 
// The names of the rule sets determine the hierarchy. Rules can be defined
// at each level of the hierarchy. Typically, more specific rules are defined
// at the lower levels. For example:
//
//     #root cause analysis
//     #root cause analysis.5whys
//     #root cause analysis.5whys.additional

// From the MyCreativity toolbox panel, you can enable or disable any rule set. 
// This allows you to use different combinations of rules for different analysis tasks.
// For example, you might choose to combine '5whys' with 'SCAMPER'. 

// SYNTAX ERRORS 
// After editing, creating and using new rules, check the errors.log file.
// The errors.log file can be found in the MyCreativity folder. The file will 
// pinpoint any syntax errors you have made by file name and rule set name. 

// MODEL SPECIFIC RULESETS
// In addition to the creativity library, Southbeach also allows rules to be embedded 
// within .sbm models. Every model can have one or more rules panels for this purpose.
// This refinement provides the best of both worlds: 
// 1) A creativity library loaded at startup which can be invoked at any time, and 
// 2) 'Model specific' rules for developing an interative application or template.
