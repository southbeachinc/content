Examination of Framing Techniques:

Examine the framing techniques employed within each narrative. How are certain aspects of the issue emphasized or de-emphasized to shape stakeholders' understanding and attitudes?

Assessment of Impact on Perceptions and Attitudes:

Assess the impact of different narratives and frames on stakeholders' perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors towards the issue. Which narratives are most influential, and why?

Identification of Conflicting or Complementary Narratives:
