Extract the model name, perspective and notes

["{model.name}"]
["{model.perspective}"]
["{model.notes}"]

A simple list of agents in the model, unnumbered, numbered, bulleted, dashed

[*]
[* ; numeric]
[* ; bullets]
[* ; dashed]

A simple list of harmful agents in the model, numbered H1, H2, etc.

[harmful ; H]

Use any notation keyword, core or derived, to extract a list of the matching agents:

[goal]
[issue+harmful]
[action+insufficient]
[dysfunctional]
etc.

A simple list of agents in the model tagged, or in a grid cell labelled, 'priority'
And how to combine multiple tags and MyCreativity keywords

[@priority]
[@priority+@soon+goal "{this} is a priority goal" ; G]

A list of the effects in the model, numbered E1, E2, etc.]
A list of the counteracting effects in the model.

[*(,) ; E]
[counteracts(,) ; C]

A list of agents increasing another harmful agent
With and without an output sentence refering to the agents involved

[increases(,harmful)]
[increases(,harmful) "Find a way to prevent {from} from increasing harmful {to}"]

A list of the TRIZ 'contradictions' in the model, defined as an agent having both
useful and harmful effects on the situation/system
And a similar list identifying increasing and decreasing effects. 

[useful(&a=*,&b=*) harmful(&a,&c=*) "{&a} is a contradiction" ; C]
[increases(&a=*,&b=*) decreases(&a,&c=*) "{&a} is both increasing {&b} and is decreasing {&c}" ; bullets]

It is possible to 'expand' any library or user defined MyCreativity ruleset into the body of a report.
The ruleset is run over all agents and effects in the model.
Here are a few examples:

A list of ideas generated by the 6 thinking hats ruleset
And a more detailed list focussed on 'green hat' thinking

[#lateral thinking.6hats]
[#lateral thinking.6hats.green: creativity]

And two examples drawing on SCAMPER creativity rules

[#lateral thinking.SCAMPER]
[#lateral thinking.SCAMPER.combine]
