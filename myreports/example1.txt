This is my report on ["{model.name}"] from perspective  ["{model.perspective}"]

Our goals are {goal}. The risks are {risk}. Choices we need to make include:
[choice ; C] 

Each raises issues:
[produces(choice, issue) "{this}" ; I]

There are several harmful effects in this situation which we need to mitigate:
[harmful(,) "{this}" ; H]

The main areas of improvement lie in:
[increases(*, harmful) "Finding a way to prevent {from} increasing harmful {to}." ; I]
[decreases(*, useful) "Finding a way to prevent {from} decreasing harmful {to}." ; I]

Actions we have already decided are:
[counteracts(action+!potential, harmful) "Intervention {from} will help to mitigate {to}"; A]

Potential new actions are:
[action+potential "Can intervention {this} help us?"; P]

It would be helpful for our next session to use Six Thinking Hats, focused on the harmful effects in the situation. We believe that a combination of black hat thinking and yellow hat thinking would be appropriate. 

For the priority areas, questions we could ask include:

Judgement questions:
[harmful(,@priority) #lateral thinking.6hats.black: judgement ; Q]

Benefits questions:
[harmful(,@priority) #lateral thinking.6hats.yellow: benefits ; Q ]

Finally, we have noted the following about the situation:
