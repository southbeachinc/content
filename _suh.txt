// System Useful Harmful (SUH) Creativity Rules
//
// A set of rules for generating simple creativity from Southbeach Models
// What 'simple' means in the context of this rule-set:
//
// Southbeach Models use Southbeach Notation, which is a superset of the original TRIZ SUH Diagrams
// This rule set is a simplified set of rules focussing on just the features of the original SUH Diagrams:
// Agents that are useful or harmful and effects that increase or decrease what they affect
// As such this rule set does not specifically refer to any of the kinds of effects of Southbeach
// such as produces, counteracts, consumes, contributes, creates, destroys, etc
// nor to any of the other Element types such as Event, Choice, Goal, Risk, etc.
// nor to any of the attributes for elaborating on these semantics, such as insufficient, potential, necesary, etc.
//
// The rules in this set will fire on all effects as it uses the general 'increases' and 'decreases' rules
// rather than specifically refering to produces, counteracts, creates, destroys, consumes, etc.
//
// The thinking behind the structure of these rules:
// Asking questions about different parts or aspects of a situation reveals more about the situation
//
// The #_experimental.SUH.statements rule patterns output descriptions of all the possible situations describable by simple MyCreativity rules
// Each of these rule patterns will identify a different context in the model based on single or multiple agents or effects
// This rule set could be considered a template for creating additional sets of rules by changing the "text" part of the rule
// Further rule sets below are defined for improving or elaborating by asking what, where, when and how questions
