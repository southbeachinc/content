A large work, many players
A recurring idea or event
A sequence is needed
Accurancy or inaccuracy
Act with freedom
Becoming slower
Before something important
By the numbers
Changing levels
Cheerfully
Conjuring an image
Double the frequency
End of a phase
Fast tempo needed
Frequency of vibration
Getting faster
Gradually quieter
Happy
In no particular key
In no particular order
In rapid succession
In time to the music
Introductory movement
Joined up thinking
Little by little
Louder please
Lowered, reduced
Mark in sections
Neither raised or lowered
Notes out of scale
Once again with feeling
Playing together
Quick repetition
Raised, increased
Relation of one to another
Same at the same time
Separated
Slow and broad
Softer please
Speed of performance
Tail end
Two or more at same time
Walking pace
