A focus on output over outcomes
A lack of customer research
An assembly line of features
An obsession with internal metrics
Fast paced twists and turns
Hampster wheels everywhere
Hiding in ivory towers
Optimization to the exclusion of all else
Overengineering for future unknowns
The bridge to nowhere
The business school
The feature creep factory
The negotiating table
The overuse of science and data
The roller coaster
The science and perfection lab
Trying to keep everyone happy
Whipsaw decision-making from the person in charge
