Bizarre, funny, visually striking or anthromorphic things stick out more than non-bizzare/funny things
To act, we must be confident we can make an impact and feel what we do is important
To avoid distakes we aim to preserve autonomy and group status, and avoid irreversible decisions
To get things done, we tend to complete things we're invested time and energy in
To stay focussed, we favour the immediate, relatable thing in front of us
We are drawn to details that confirm our own existing belies
We discard specifics to form generalities
We edit and reinforce some memories after the fact
We favour simple-looking options and complete information over complex, ambiguious options
We fill in characteristics from stereotypes, generalities and prior histories
We imagine things and people we're familiar with or fond of as better
We notice flaws in others more easily than we notice in ourselves
We notice things already primed in memory or repeated often
We notice when something has changed
We project our current mindset and assumptions onto the past and future
We reduce events and list to their key elements
We simplify probabilities and numbers to make them easier to think about
We store memories differently based on how they are experienced
We tend to find stories and patterns even when looking at sparse data
We think we know what other people are thinking
