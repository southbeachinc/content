All-or-nothing thinking
Allowing your vision of reality to become darkened
Anticipating that things will turn out badly
Arbitrarily concluding that someone is reacting negatively to you
Assuming that negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are
Dismissing positives by insisting they “don’t count” for some reason
Disqualifying the positive
Exaggerating the importance of things such as your goof-up or someone else's achievement
Instead of describing the error, attacting it to yourself
Jumping to unhelpful conclusions
Making a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts
Overgeneralization
Picking out a defeat and dwelling on it exclusively
Reading the other's mind wrongly; thinking the worst
Seeing things in black-and-white categories
Seeing yourself as the cause of a negative external event you feel responsible for
Strinking things until they disappear, for example your achievement or other's imperfections
Thinking that a single negative event is part of a never-ending pattern of defeat
Trying to motivate yourself with shoulds and shouldn'ts, musts and oughts
