Controlling
Expert at lying and denying
Guilt trips and gaslights

Isolates you from others
Makes fun of you and judges you
Makes you question yourself and your sanity
Never accepts blame
Plays dumb to avoid blame
Pretty yet passive aggresive
Seeks out emotional and vulnerable people
Self obsessed
Uses the silent treatment to get their way
