Apologize to someone you've hurt
Ask a friend how you can be there for them
Ask a friend to help you process your thoughts
Be mindful of what your thoughts focus on
Bravely communicate your needs
Clean out and donate items that no longer bring you joy
Do one fun thing just for yourself
Do something new you've always wanted to try
Forgive yourself hurtful choices you've made
Give yourself grace as you work towards letting go
Give yourself time alone to process your thoughts
Grieve the experiences you had wanted
Journal a good memory and what you loved about it
Let yourself cry, without judgement
Let yourself freely feel all of your feelings
List out new pattern you want to establish
List out your dreams and goals for your future
Notice patterns that are no longer serving you
Notice the moments you become triggered
Notive where others have repeatedly hurt you
Practice accepting your past
Practice pausing before reacting
Question any thought that limits someone else
Question any thought that limits you
Question any thought that uses 'always' and 'never'
Reorganize a small space in your home
Set a firm boundary where needed
Speak kindly to yourself
Start doing one thing you need to do to achieve your goals
Write affirmations and reminders to keep you going
