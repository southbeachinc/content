Avoid parameter changes that have harmful side effects
Bringing the identical or similar together, assemble multiple to parallelise
Change solution parameters according to need
Change the appearance to make it fit in or stand out
Change the shape, envelope, or guard-rails to change stimulation, flexibility, or predictability
Change, control, or develop aspects of an agent to make it more suitable
Combine agents with opposite qualities so they cancel out
Create a buffer, slack, reserves, or compensatory action in preparation
Create new agents by combining the best of multiple kinds of agents to achieve the desired capability
Create the space you need by adding dimensions, layers, stories, axes, apects
Divide into independent segmented parts
Divide into parts and make it flexible by linking the parts
Enable agents to help themselves either from the environment or by adding self improving or maintaining functions
Find a way to make use of harmful side effects or factors in the environment
Find the easiest way to achieve the goal whilst removing unwanted side effects
Get the most out of everything all the time
Go with the flow, or design for adaptability to the changing environment
Identify and make use of resource variance during changes, especially repeated, periodic changes
Introduce feedback to improve a process or action
Invert or use actions that are in some sense opposite
Make an agent perform multiple functions, eliminate the need for multiple agents
Make more of something to increase capacity
Make more of the useful, instead of using expensive or originals, make copies that are just good enough
Make use of a temporary change to a quality of something just long enough to make it fit in the system
Once an agent has fulfilled its function, discard it and recover it later
Perform an action with harmful side effects quickly to reduce its harm
Perform the required change before it is needed
Permit flow with semi-permeable interfaces, or storage with accessible internal structures
Precede a harmful action with a compensating one to cancel it out
Provide different quality solutions in different areas depending on need
Put one agent inside another, repeat
Replace a continuous action with a periodic one
Replace a physical solution with a sensory or field-based one
Replace a reactant, transformation agent, or energy source with a more powerful one
Replace agents requiring maintenance with discardable, replaceable agents
Replace an irritating or toxic environment with with a bland or unobtrusive one
Replace rigid or breakable structures with more fluid, flexible, and reactive agents
Separate an interfering part or property, or single out the necessary part
Use an intermediary instead of the real thing to protect it
Use an intermediary to enable an action that otherwise would not be possible
Use an intermediary to isolate, insulate, protect, ease, or otherwise improve an interface or process
Use lighter weight, simpler, or easier to manage surfaces, layers, or structures
Use oscillation, change the frequency, find a way to resonate
Use parts or particles instead of the whole thing
Use similar or identical agents that need to work together to avoid harmful side effects to adverse reactions to differences
Use structures that are inherently strong or paths that inherently flow
Work with a copy to reduce risk to the original, e.g. so the original doesn't get damaged
