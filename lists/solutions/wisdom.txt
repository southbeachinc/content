A characteristic of wisdom is not to do desperate things
A little progress every day adds up to big results
Aim for your dreams
Always do what you are afraid to do
Be careful about what you think
Be strong and bold
Believe and act as if it were impossible to fail
By changing nothing, nothing changes
Carpe Diem
Celebrate every small success
Change before you are forced to
Circumstances are the rulers of the weak
Complaining will not get anything done
Create your own path
Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment
Do not take life too seriously
Do one thing every day that scares you
Do what inspires you
Do what is right, not what is easy nor what is popular
Doing less than the other guy is not a good strategy
Don't focus on fighting the old, but on building the new
Don't lose yourself along the way to a goal
Don't settle for what life gives you
Don't wish it were easier; wish you were better
Each failure makes success that much closer
Failure is an option
Forget about the fast lane
Go as far as you can see
Habit is what keeps you going
Hard problems take work
I criticize by creation, not by finding fault
If there is no struggle, there is no progress
If you can't change something, change the way you think about it
If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there
If you don't like something, change it
If you ever feel it's not right, then it's not
In the end, you have to choose whether or not to trust someone
It always seems impossible until it's done
It's important to make time
Lack of direction, not lack of time, is the problem
Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist
Learning is a lifelong process
Life is simple, but we insist on making it complicated
Light a candle in the darkest moments
Light the night up with your potential
Lost time is never found again
Love the people who love you back
Make life better and build something
No' simply means begin again at one level higher
Not failure, but low aim, is the crime
O, what a tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive
Only he who attempts the absurd is capable of achieving the impossible
Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone
Opportunities don't happen; you create them
Opportunity is always knocking
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up
Patience is a learned skill
Play to your strengths
Problem solving is not about compromise
Progress comes with practice, and practice comes with purpose
Pursue what catches your heart, not what catches your eyes
Remember to laugh at the small stuff
Set a goal that liberates your energy and inspires your hopes
Sometimes, when you fall, you fly
Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can
Strive not to be a success but rather to be of value
Take total responsibility for our attitudes
Taking the wrong path is part of the process
The bad news is time flies; the good news is you're the pilot
The best revenge is massive success
The best way out is always through
The best way to predict your future is to create it
The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph
The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step
The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones
The measure of intelligence is the ability to change
The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision
The wisest men follow their own direction
There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still
There is nothing permanent except change
To discover the limits of the possible, venture a little way past them into the impossible
To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often
Tough times never last, but tough people do
Trust your gut
What happens is not as important as how you react to what happens
What we think determines what happens to us
What you plant now, you will harvest later
Whatever choice you make makes you
Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve
When goals cannot be reached, don't adjust the goals, adjust the action steps
When you dream, dream together
Without work one finishes nothing
Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen
You are perfect because of your imperfections
You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with
You can never plan the future by the past
You must be the change you wish to see in the world
You must not only aim right, but draw the bow with all your might
You need to fail to grow
You never really learn much from hearing yourself speak
You've done your best
Your big opportunity may be right where you are standing right now
