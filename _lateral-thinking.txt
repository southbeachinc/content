// Six Thinking Hats, inspired by the work of Edward De Bono
//

// White - facts and figures - information available and needed
// Red - feelings and emotions - opinions, intuition and hunches
// Black - devil's advocate - critical judgement, why it won't work, cautions and difficulties
// Yellow - positive view - why it will work, values and benefits
// Green - innovation and new ideas - alternatives and creative thinking
// Blue - the big picture - managing the thinking process
